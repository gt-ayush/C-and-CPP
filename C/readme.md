### The C Masterclass Roadmap

Since you know logic (loops/if-else are nearly identical in C and Java), we will move fast on syntax and spend most of our time on **Memory & Pointers**, which is the hardest part for Python developers.

* **Module 1: The Skeleton & Data Types** (Headers, Main, Format Specifiers)  *Starting here.*
* **Module 2: Control Flow & Logic** (Quick refresh)
* **Module 3: Functions & Scope** (Pass by value)
* **Module 4: Arrays & Strings** (The "char array" concept)
* **Module 5: POINTERS** (The Boss Level - Direct memory access)
* **Module 6: Structures** (How we make objects without Classes)
* **Module 7: Dynamic Memory** (`malloc` & `free`)
